# Pixhawk Plus #
The [Pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/choice) and [PX4](http://px4.io/) flight stack are workhorses in DIY drone world.  

Often paired with an OpenTX receiver such as the FrSky, you have a powerful combination.

1. Telemetry pass-through from the Pixhawk to your OpenTX receiver.
2. Robust LED indicator lights--multiple arms, multiple programs.
