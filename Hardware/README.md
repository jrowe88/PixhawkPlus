# Pixhawk Plus Circuit Boards #
This folder contains Eagle files for corresponding hardware. These boards are not required, but make the packaging neater than soldering a bunch of wires to a Teensy 3.2.

You can order your own, simply wire to the Teensy, or come up with your own creation.  See the Wiki for more options and ideas.

##Primary Board:##
This code and "backpack" are designed to work with [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html) development board.  Probably would world with Feather, or Arduino Mini, but I haven't tried that.
